<h1 hidden>Music</h1>
<h2>How do we choose our music?</h2>
<p>We have quite an eclectic repertoire.</p>
<p>Most of our repertoire is chosen by our chef de choeur, Sylvia, and we sing a lot of her arrangements.</p>
<p>Any member of the choir can request a song, and sooner or later it’ll find its way into our repertoire.</p>
<p>As well as French songs, we sing songs from the folk music of many other nations. So we sing in lots of languages. </p>
<p>Sometimes sixties songs – who doesn’t love them!</p>
<p>Basically we sing songs we love. Wherever they come from.</p>
<p>One exciting development: poems written by members of the choir have been put to music by Sylvia.</p>
<p>It’s a special joy to sing those. Our own! Home-grown!</p>
<p>We are always looking for chances for different members of the choir to shine, so our concerts always include solos and small groups. We have some wonderful singers!</p>
