This is a web site for http://villebeauson.fr

The Web files are in the `WebSite` subdirectory.
They're mostly static HTML, a little CSS, no JavaScript.

The 'VillebeausonMake` folder contains code to create the (static) HTML fles.
The code in this project is written in C#, and compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

The web site is tested on Windows (using Visual Studio), and hosted on Apache and Linux by http://1and1.fr
(that's why it has `Web.config` files and an `.htaccess` file).
