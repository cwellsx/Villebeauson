# How do we choose our music?
We have quite an eclectic repertoire.
Most of our repertoire is chosen by our chef de choeur, Sylvia, and we sing a lot of her arrangements.
Any member of the choir can request a song, and sooner or later it’ll find its way into our repertoire.

As well as French songs, we sing songs from the folk music of many other nations. So we sing in lots of languages. 
Sometimes sixties songs – who doesn’t love them!

Basically we sing songs we love. Wherever they come from.

One exciting development: poems written by members of the choir have been put to music by Sylvia.
It’s a special joy to sing those. Our own! Home-grown!

We are always looking for chances for different members of the choir to shine, so our concerts always include solos and small groups. We have some wonderful singers!
