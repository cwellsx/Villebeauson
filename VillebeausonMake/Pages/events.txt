# Events
We believe that music is for sharing. So we give concerts mainly in order that people can hear our music.
That’s especially important to us since our repertoire is unique.
We also do fund-raising concerts, and often take part in community events like Telethon.
We sing whenever we get the chance – it was grand to be invited to sing in the Tour de France parade in Sainte MèreEglise.
It’s an honour for us every year to sing for the Commemoration Ceremony for the Fusillés de Beaucoudray.
We have a long-standing friendship with the Quangle-Wangle choir based in Weymouth, UK, and for years we have made exchange visits to Dorset and have welcomed them here in Normandy.
